## Topic
Our project will be an exploration of the relation between college and professional sports, specifically baseball and basketball. In particular, we seek to determine how vicinity of a college to a professional sports team affects the revenue of that sport at that college.

- MLB team/stadium locations.
- NBA team/stadium locations.
